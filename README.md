Introduction:
Mental health has gained an immense amount of awareness over the past few decades, but now more than ever it is becoming more important to become aware of employee mental health in the workplace. In the tech industry especially, the culture is not known to be the most healthyâ€“ burnouts are common, due to the difficulty employees have when seeking out a good work-life balance (Pilsl, 2022). Our team finds this topic relevant and important because we have all either worked or potentially will work in the technology industry, and drawing on our experiences, we found common ground in the fact that mental health can be put on the back burner in such a taxing work environment. We aim to create a narrative that draws attention to and creates awareness for the general mental health struggles that employees across the country face while working in the technology industry.
